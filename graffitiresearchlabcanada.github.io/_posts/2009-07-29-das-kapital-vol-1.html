<p>GRL + Ghetto Blast - rap-up!</p>
<p>(originally posted <a href="http://www.artengine.ca/blog/index.php" target="_blank">here</a> )</p>
<p>GRL - Ottawa founding<br />
Writers: MediaH, Hiero, Fresh Customs<br />
Lumens: 8K</p>
<p>all y'all:</p>
<p>so, it's safe to announce that this event was, shall we say, a 'qualified' success; as you know if you were anywhere within 200km of Ottawa this past weekend, in the immortal words of <em>Steve</em> <em>Reich</em> vs <em>Brother</em> <em>Walter</em> (and the newscaster from Family Guy), 'It's Gonna Rain!" We literally had moats of aqua six inches deep around the projectors...</p>

<p>despite <em>Mother</em> <em>Nature</em> doing her best at the behest of her imperialist masters (read:<em>Govt </em>weather experiments - the Department of National Defense was only 200ft away) to shut us down, we went ahead, with the assistance of a <em>Canadian</em> <em>Tire</em> sale on car canopies.</p>

<p>I guess standing out in the wet only made our esteemed writers - <em><a href="http://iahdigital.com/">Mediah</a></em>, <em><a href="http://decafed.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Hiero</a></em>, and the <em><a href="http://www.freshcustoms.com/" target="_blank">Fresh Customs</a></em> crew (much respect) only want to write tags and not take the time to take their pieces to some next level... which I totally understand!</p>

<p>But the <em>bombIR</em> software was working nice, and <em>Artengine</em> will be holding on to a few new IR Pens for posterity...</p>

<p><em>Ghetto Blas</em><em>t</em> and <em>Huggs</em> both <strong>killed</strong> (ie. Michael dropping a <em>Futura</em> <em>2000</em> record - what!!) the soundsystem(s) for what it was worth, and the crowd that did show up was enthusiastic... so thanks for that. And thanks to <a href="http://lechampiondumonde.com/" target="_blank">Le Champion Du Monde</a> for the fotos.</p>

<p>We cancelled the mobile L.A.S.E.R. Tag event the next night too (sorry to <em>House of Paint</em> and <em>TimeKode</em>), as our shoes still weren't dry by the time we woke up and checked the weather channel, only to see it say 80% chance of suckiness.</p>
<p>But in the end, we built some strong beginnings for a <em>GRL</em> chapter in Ottawa, and rest assured we will be doing some more badness this coming month as I (<em>Agent</em> <em>Scott)</em>teams up with <em>Artengine</em> and <em>Ghetto Blast</em> to solidify our gains here... stay tuned kids!</p>
