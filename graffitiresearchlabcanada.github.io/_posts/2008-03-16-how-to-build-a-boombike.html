<p>In the coming month we will be building a mobile audiovisual projection rig.  Fitted onto the back of bike, we will have a full range stereo, fm transmitter and projector mounted on the bike trailer.  This means we can setup anywhere in town, bomb a wall with tunes playing and have passers-by tune in to our frequency in their cars! We will be providing detailed information on the construction process and technologies involved.<br class="webkit-block-placeholder" />To be continued......</p>
