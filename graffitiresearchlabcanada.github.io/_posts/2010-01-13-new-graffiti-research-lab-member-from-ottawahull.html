<p>My name is Kerry and I am a new member of the Graffiti Research Lab Family. My partner Michael and I have a sound system that is run off batteries that are charged by solar panels and we call ourselves the Ghettoblast sound system. We are very interested in low impact and environmentally friendly art and so we are especially pleased to have partnered with Artengine and Graffiti Research Labs. This is my first posting on this blog and it is definitely a little late. Below was our second event GRL event.<br />
Awesome Indies was held in the Hintonburg community on October 2nd- 4th, 2009. The festival partnered with GRL, artengine, and Ghettoblast sound system to present the following events:<br />
<strong>Friday</strong>: Ghettoblast sounds system brought our portable sound system to run the music and announcements during the opening ceremonies and for the breakdancers.<br />
Ghettoblast also set up GRLâ€™s bombIR in the courtyard of the Patrick John Mills Contemporary Fine Art Gallery. Stephan Thompson a graffiti artist who now only uses environmentally friendly materials drew fabulous pictures and facilitated the use of bombIR by many festival participants.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong>: Members of the Ghettoblast Sound system gave an LED throwie workshop. All the kids and parents enjoyed this workshop immensely. Each participant was able to illuminate an LED and had lots of fun experimenting with the technology. In the evening, the GRL laser tag was set up for participants to try and also to have a place to show off the new LED throwies.</p>
