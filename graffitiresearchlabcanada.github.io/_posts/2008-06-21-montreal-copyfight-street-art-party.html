<p><strong>Join Us Thursday, June 26th, 9pm</strong></p>
<p>Join Graffiti Research Lab Montreal and Fair Copyright for Canada Montreal for a fun filled evening of video art, street art and music, to protest Copyright Bill C-61: a draconian piece of federal government legislation which, if passed into law this fall, would fundamentally change the digital media landscape for the worst, making Canadians into copyright criminals by slapping hefty fines on anyone who trades music, makes backup copies of DVDs or even uploads a YouTube mashup.</p>
<p>We’re taking the protest to the streets, enlisting Graffiti Research Lab Montreal’s latest weapon: the boombike. GRL have built a custom bike trailer complete with integrated sound system, video projection and FM broadcasting! Powered by a deep cell battery system, this baby weighs a ton and is sure to turn heads with large scale projection and big sound.</p>
<p>Festivities kick off at the corner of <strong>Ste-Catherine Est and St-Laurent at 9pm Thursday June 26th</strong>, then move to the square at St. Catherine and Amherst in the village at 10pm and later up to somewhere mysterious in the Plateau neighborhood.</p>
<p>- Join the party, and take in the amazing work of local video, graffiti and music artists protesting this bill</p>
<p>- Bring your own protest videos, music mashups, and street art pics to the event, ready to upload to the boombike computer (signup at 8pm). You can also upload videos here:</p>
