<p>Hey guys, just updated the video online. The arts festival showing here went well, and was well received despite the rain. Now its time to find some good walls and make our rounds one night showing it to the rest of the city (if they like it or not) haha. </p>
<p>If anyone has questions about technique, ways to improve or anything else send me an email: earwash@hotmail.com</p>
<p>Here is the link to the video <a href="http://vimeo.com/12189032">http://vimeo.com/12189032</a></p>
