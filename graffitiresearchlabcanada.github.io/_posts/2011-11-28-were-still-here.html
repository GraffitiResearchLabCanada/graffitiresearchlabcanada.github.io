<p>We know this page hasn't been very active lately, with Agent Scott running with the Bears at GRL Germany and Agent NomIg running with the NeoGrafik project, but just a quick word of support to say that we're still here, being vigilant, cooking up ideas... the price of new media liberty is eternal new media vigilance! (we could probably just make an Arduino program for that though, eh?)</p>
