<p>Last weekend Agent Scott did a workshop at the <a href="http://indigitaltech.ca/" target="_blank">InDigital</a> "Tech Your Life" weekend, teaching First Nations Youth about creative code, software art, and guerilla installations.</p>
<p>We went through some various GRLC projects, and ended by teaching them to program a basic drawing system in <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>.</p>
<p>The weekend also featured installations and a conference on digital art and media empowerment.</p>
