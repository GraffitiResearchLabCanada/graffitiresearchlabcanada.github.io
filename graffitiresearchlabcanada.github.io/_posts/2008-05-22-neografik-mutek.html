<p>The GRL Canada crew will be hitting up <a href="http://www.mutek.org" target="_blank">MUTEK</a> this coming May 30th and 31st.</p>
<p><center>[singlepic=16,320,240,]</center></p>
<p>Special Agents Fluke and <a href="http://axe.burnemall.com/" target="_blank">Axe</a> will be manning the Weapons of Mass Defacement during two evenings offering up specially created works for MUTEK.  All civilians are invited to come watch the defacements happen live and to participate in their own rebellion using the highly interactive laser tagging system.  Training provided on-site by Special Ops Commanders JG and <a href="http://www.nomig.net" target="_blank">NomIg.</a></p>
<p>This will also be the introduction of our latest weapon: the boombike.  Using plans from our southern conspirators we have built a custom bike trailer complete with integrated sound system, projection mount and FM broadcasting!  Powered by a deep cell battery system, this baby weighs a ton and is sure to turn heads.</p>
<p>We will officially be setting up at multiple spots throughout the two evenings between <b>9pm and 12am</b>:</p>
<p><b>Friday, May 30th</b><br />Laser Tagging @ St. Laurent &amp; Ste. Catherine (<b>10pm - 12am</b>)<br />Muralling @ Place-des-Arts (<b>@ 9:30pm</b>)<br />Muralling @ St. Urbain &amp; Ste. Catherine (<b>@ 10:30pm</b>)</p>
<p><b>Saturday, May 31st</b><br />Laser Tagging & Muralling @ St. Laurent &amp; Ste. Catherine (<b>9pm - 12am</b>).<br />  </p>
<p>Come check it.</p>
