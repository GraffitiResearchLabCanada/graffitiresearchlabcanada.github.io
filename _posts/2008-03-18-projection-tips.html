<p>Projection is a medium unto itself; one in which you are always fighting a battle to have your image appear brightest.  Wall colour, ambient lighting, projection content are all conspiring against your image being the brightest it can be.  We have put together a list of tips to help you get the most out of your projections.<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>-whenever possible project on a white surface.  dark colours will substantially degrade the visibility of your projection as they absorb light more. concrete grey works well too.</li>
<p>
<li>-surface material matters too.  opaque reflective materials can help make your image brighter.  windows do NOT work unless they have curtains or blinds down behind them.</li>
<p>
<li>-keep your imagery as highly contrasted as possible.  white on a black background is the most easily seen.  </li>
<p>
<li>-when you use colour, keep it light.   if you use soft tones and delicate shading, it can just kind of disappear.  reds are the hardest to project (but work when surrounded by black).  however yellows, light orange, bright greens and bright blues turn out well.  dark blues and purples won't turn out.  basically we want white values in our colours and high contrast.</li>
<p>
<li>-the size of your image is directly related to the lens on the projector and the distance from the projector to the wall (the "throw").  with most projectors you can roughly calculate that your projected image size will be half your throw.  so the projector is 50 feet away?  then your image will be 25ft wide (roughly).</li>
<p>
<li>-lumens determines everything.  if you've got 5000 lumens i wouldn't try anything more than 80ft for your throw which will give you about a 40ft image.  you can figure on a 40ft throw for 2500 lumen projector.</li>
<p>
<li>-DLP projectors are better than LCD.  more bang for your buck and kinda like they have more lumens than listed.</li>
<p>
<li>-any lights projected on your projection surface will obviously take away from the visibility of your projection.  always project onto dark walls if possible - especially if you are doing a long throw or have a weak projector.</li>
<p>
<li>-small text just won't be visible.  everything needs to be big and clunky.  it's a drag for arty types but it's part of the limitations of the medium (when working in sub-par conditions like guerilla projection).  remember high contrasts in your content!</li>
<p>
<li>-the life of the bulb in the projector makes a huge difference.  newer is always better.</li>
</ul>
