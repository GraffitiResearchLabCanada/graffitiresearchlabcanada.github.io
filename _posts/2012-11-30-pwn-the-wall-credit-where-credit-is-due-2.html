<p><strong>PWN THE WALL</strong> was a digital graffiti intervention connecting Vancouver, Berlin, and Seoul,  Oct 12-14, 2012.  It was supported by the Goethe Institut's Satellite program in Vancouver, and the Canada Council for the Arts.  Importantly, many people came together to realize the project, their names are listed below.</p>
<p>PWN THE WALL was a project between Graffiti Research Lab Canada and Germany. Members include Jesse Scott (Vancouver), Mirae Rosner (Vancouver), Semiramis Ceylan (Berlin), and Hauke Altmann (Berlin).</p>
<p>This project furthered GRL's ongoing commitment to urban interventions that take graffiti into the digital age through open approaches to community and technology. Data produced through digital graffiti technologies was live-streamed and re-projected, collapsing geographical space through public events in three continents. GRL members in all three cities produced and distributed this project exclusively through open-source tools and technologies.</p>
