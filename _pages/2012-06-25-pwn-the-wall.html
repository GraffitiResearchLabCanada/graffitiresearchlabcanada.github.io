<p>PWN THE WALL was a 25 hour interactive digital graffiti event connecting Vancouver, Berlin, and Seoul. Created by GRL members in Canada, Germany, and South Korea, PWN THE WALL uses open-source technology to collapse geographical space through a real-time telematic exchange. Simultaneous live digital painting events in all three cities showcased local graffiti writers. The installation was interactive and open to the public for the duration of  PWN THE WALL.</p>
<p>PWN THE WALL continued our collaboration with German colleagues at <a href="http://www.graffitiresearchlab.de/">GRL Germany</a>. After working together to create 'Light Rider' (mobile projection bike) and Original G-Code (live drawing to 3-D fabrication system), our collectively-run groups developed the technology to produce digital graffiti that was live-streamed and re-projected, collapsing geographical space through a series of public events and ongoing interactive installations. GRL Canada Members include Jesse Scott &amp; Mirae Rosner with Semiramis Ceylan, Hauke Altmann and Achim Kern comprising the main team at GRL Germany.</p>
<p>The final installation took the form of a networked 3-Channel video installation, with one interactive screen for each city, and two screens that represent real time updates from the interactive screens in the other two cities. During certain times, commissioned graffiti writers created custom pieces on the interactive wall, and these pieces were also projected on a much larger surface, drawing remote graffiti on the local, urban fabric.</p>
<p>We coded and produced and distributing this project exclusively through open-source tools and technologies. PWN THE WALL furthers our ongoing commitment to urban interventions that take graffiti into the digital age through open approaches to community and technology.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Deets</strong></p>
<p>PWN THE WALL was a networked, three channel video installation, designed to operate with several simultaneous installations in different locations. The video channels are rear projection screens, and one exhibition computer runs all three channels in each installation.</p>
<p>One video channel in each installation is an interactive screen, designed to work with an infrared pen - a spray can outfitted with an infrared LED. The artist gestures against the rear projection screen, while an infrared camera situated behind the screen tracks the IR LED from the spray can. The computer software receives the position of the tracked point in real time, and projects digital ‘paint’ at the matching point. There is an on-screen interface where the artist can change the colour and style of ‘paint, add drips, change from ‘marker’ to ‘spray paint’, etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, the software sends the tracked point and paint colour/style to a server, which allows other installations to request those details and redraw them as part of their own installation. Each installation can request the data from any other installation on the second and third channels, and display that in real time on any appropriate screens.</p>
<p>For PWN THE WALL, we worked between three installations in three cities, each with three channels/screens. So, for the installation in Vancouver, the second and third channels displayed the generated output from the installation in Berlin and Seoul.</p>
<p>We tested the basic software components, networking with our Berlin allies, during <a href="http://2012.newformsfestival.com/">New Forms Festival</a>, September 13-15 2012. We’re happy to say the networking software ran smoothly between the two cities and that the public was able to interact in realtime through the use of a wacom tablet.</p>
