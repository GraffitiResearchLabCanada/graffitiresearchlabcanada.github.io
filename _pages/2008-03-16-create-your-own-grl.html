<p>We want you to create your own local chapter of GRL.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to read through the site, learn from our successes and mistakes, and create your own GRL events in your local area. We will be publishing guides and how-to's on the site as both documentation of our efforts as well as inspiration and help to others wanting to join the cause.</p>
<p>Ideally we'd like the site to become a community space where people can get together, meet up and discuss ideas for projects.  We can share our experiences, inspire one another and together help spread art not ads.</p>
<p>Leave comments here if you are wanting to do events in your area or to share ideas...</p>
